## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- It's always a good idea to take some time to think through the best way to do the CSS format
- Don't be afraid to use HTML tables especially for alignment of elements. They are easy to implement

### Continued development

I want to focus on implementing Javascript and Bootstrap into the website

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.getbootstrap.com) - This helped me in getting themes and ideas of how to tackle the challenge. I really liked this example tab and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.codeply.com) - This is another amazing website which is helpful to kick around and try new code especially if you want to implement Bootstrap. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
